This is the frontend of my personal website. The goal with this website is to have a 2-in-1 blog and portfolio website. Reason being that I required a portfolio website and a blog website where I could share my findings with react and django. So having a 2-in-1 website works really well. This frontend is being developed using reactJS, backend will be developed using django and the code will be shared once I start work on it. The whole code plus tips will be shared on my youtube channel and on the website as a blog.
